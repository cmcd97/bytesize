# Public Directory

The `public` directory contains static assets for the project. These assets are publicly accessible and typically include files such as:

- **HTML files**: The main entry points for the web application.
- **CSS files**: Stylesheets for the application.
- **JavaScript files**: Client-side scripts.
- **Images**: Logos, icons, and other image assets.
- **Fonts**: Custom fonts used in the application.

These files are served directly to the client without any processing by the server, ensuring fast and efficient delivery of static content.
