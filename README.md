Bytesize is a web application template designed to help you kickstart your web development projects with ease. The core philosophy of Bytesize is simplicity and lightweight performance.

## Features

- **Preconfigured Pocketbase Backend**: Easily manage your backend with Pocketbase.
- **Modern Frontend Stack**: Utilizes Templ, HTMX, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI for a seamless and responsive user interface.
- **Hot Reloading**: Air is preconfigured to enable hot reloading in the browser, enhancing your development workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Go**: [Download Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
2. **Node and NPM**: [Download Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en)
3. **Air**: Install Air with the following command:
   ```sh
   curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/air-verse/air/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```
   Then, alias Air (if Air is not found):
   ```sh
   alias air='$(go env GOPATH)/bin/air'
   ```
4. **Templ**: Install Templ with the following command:

   Note: You may need to run the `templ generate --watch --proxy="http://localhost:3000" --open-browser=true` command manually the first time before using the makefile command.

   ```sh
   go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
   ```

   Add the Go path to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```

   Source the file:

   ```sh
   source ~/.bashrc
   # or
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   Check the Templ version:

   ```sh
   templ --version
   ```

5. **TailwindCSS**: Install TailwindCSS with NPM:
   ```sh
   npm install -D tailwindcss
   ```
   Initialize TailwindCSS:
   ```sh
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

   cd bytesize
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   you make also need to run `templ generate` to generate the go files otherwise you will get an error stating that your local packages are not found

3. **Run the Application in Development Mode**:

   in separate terminals:

   ```sh
   air
   ```

   ```sh
   make templ
   ```

   ```sh
   make css
   ```

4. **Run the Application in Production Mode**:

   ```sh
   make run
   ```

5. **Build the Binary**:

   If you just want to build the binary you will find an `app` binary in the `./bin` directory after running this command

   ```sh
   make build
   ```

## Documentation

Every directory contains a `README.md` file which explains the purpose of the directory and how you can make use of it. Feel free to delete these if you want, they are only there to help provide context to the repo structure.

#### Disclaimer

A large amount of the documentation is generated by ChatGPT, I will update it as I use this template in my future projects, otherwise feel free submit improvements

## Inspiration

I started learning Go by building webapps with HTMX and Templ. I learned a lot from the [Anthony GG]('https://www.youtube.com/@anthonygg_") YouTube channel and based my first template off of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/FU1kYukjwJM?si=51mLdiNyjPCKHnd6) and the [Superkit](https://github.com/anthdm/superkit) repo. After building a few apps with this template I wanted to try an integrate [Pocketbase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase). I came across [pocketbase-htmx](https://github.com/gobeli/pocketbase-htmx) from a reddit thread. I really liked the project structure of this repo but it didn't include any hot reloading (Air) or any sort of styling. Bytesize is my attempt of taking the hot reloading and UI styling from [Superkit](https://github.com/anthdm/superkit) and combining it with the project structure of [pocketbase-htmx](https://github.com/gobeli/pocketbase-htmx).
