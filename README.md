## Documentation

Every directory contains a `README.md` file which explains the purpose of the directory and how you can make use of it. Feel free to delete these if you want, they are only there to help provide context to the repo structure.

#### Disclaimer

A large amount of the documentation is generated by ChatGPT, I will update it as I use this template in my future projects, otherwise feel free submit improvements

## Inspiration

I started learning Go by building webapps with HTMX and Templ. I learned a lot from the [Anthony GG]('https://www.youtube.com/@anthonygg_") YouTube channel and based my first template off of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/FU1kYukjwJM?si=51mLdiNyjPCKHnd6). I really liked the Templ and Air combo, but I preferred DaisyUI over PinesJS. After building a few apps with this template I wanted to try an integrate [Pocketbase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase) and I came across [pocketbase-htmx](https://github.com/gobeli/pocketbase-htmx). I liked this repo a lot but it didn't come with Air. So I combined the directory structure and Pocketbase integration from Gobeli's `pocketbase-htmx` repo with the Air reloading and UI library integration of Anthony GG's `Superkit` repo to create Bytesize.
