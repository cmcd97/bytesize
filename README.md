## Documentation

Every directory contains a `README.md` file which explains the purpose of the directory and how you can make use of it. Feel free to delete these if you want, they are only there to help provide context to the repo structure.

#### Disclaimer

A large amount of the documentation is generated by ChatGPT, I will update it as I use this template in my future projects, otherwise feel free submit improvements

## Inspiration

I started learning Go by building webapps with HTMX and Templ. I learned a lot from the [Anthony GG]('https://www.youtube.com/@anthonygg_") YouTube channel and based my first template off of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/FU1kYukjwJM?si=51mLdiNyjPCKHnd6) and the [Superkit](https://github.com/anthdm/superkit) repo. After building a few apps with this template I wanted to try an integrate [Pocketbase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase). I came across [pocketbase-htmx](https://github.com/gobeli/pocketbase-htmx) from a reddit thread. I really liked the project structure of this repo but it didn't include any hot reloading (Air) or any sort of styling. Bytesize my attempt of taking the hot reloading and UI styling from [Superkit](https://github.com/anthdm/superkit) and combining it with the project structure of [pocketbase-htmx](https://github.com/gobeli/pocketbase-htmx).
